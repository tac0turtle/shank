# Shank

Shank is a simple, lightweight, and easy to use consensus library. The main objectives is to build a sustainable and modular rust consensus engine for use with applications. We don't want to reinvent the wheel, but we do want to make it easier to use.

Shank is meant to offer stable and sane defaults to compose a consensus engine with. It is not meant to be a full fledged consensus engine, but rather a library to build one with. Shank is meant to be used with a state machine, and is not meant to be a state machine itself.
